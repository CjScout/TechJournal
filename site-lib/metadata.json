Acquisition","icon":"","description":"\nThe ultimate goal of a digital forensics investigation is to preserve, identify, acquire and document digital evidence to be used in the court of law.\nAcquisition is the single most important step. You get one chance, because looking through files or booting up the computer will destroy the evidence. Things to consider procedurally: Order of volatility\nImaging methods\nForensic image files formats\nCapabilities of imaging tools\nKeep continuity in mind.&nbsp;\nWrite-blockers\nImage validation.\nLast but most important documentation, aka CoC. Of the types below, the first two can only be captured while the machine being investigated is running.\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20260124021526.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20260124021526.png\" target=\"_self\">\nDuring an investigation, the original evidence cannot be analyzed directly. A copy must be used to avoid contamination. A copy provides the actual data of a file without any extra information, such as the file’s metadata.\nBecause of the importance of metadata and other information on the drive, digital forensic investigators capture an image of the drive.\nImaging an evidence drive allows capturing the entire drive bit-by-bit, including actual files, data in slack space, swap files, and unallocated space (which may contain deleted files).\nIf a drive failed, you can replace it with its clone, not its image\nImages can be compressed and fragmented Create two images from the evidence drive, hence, in case one got corrupted, the second one can be used for further analysis.\nUse two different tools for image acquisition. Photos can be attached to the CoC to show the evidence state at the collection time. This is very important in case of acquiring a powered-on machine, which has running applications on its screen. Acquisition validation is used to ensure that the forensic image is identical to the source.\nValidation of digital evidence involves using a hashing algorithm to generate a hash value (aka fingerprint), which is a unique binary or hexadecimal number.\nIdentical files will always have the same fingerprint even if their names differ.\nIntegrity check guarantees that the data has not been corrupted or altered during the acquisition process. data integrity should be verified using verification algorithms, such as: Message Digest 5 (MD5) hash\nSecure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)\nSHA-2 The physical image is the entire hard drive; it copies all zeroes and ones on the drive. Hence, a physical image of a 1TB drive will generate an image file of size 1 TB. This is the most common in digital forensic and it is important in case you suspect that the evidence has been deleted or modified. The logical image is a part of the hard drive, a certain volume(s) of the drive. For example, if a hard drive contains two partitions, D and E, the logical image would be data from E: drive or D: drive. This is very useful in case you are interested only in the information contained in the drive. In some cases, you know what files you need for the investigation. If the target machine is powered on and running, the acquisition is called live acquisition Live acquisition helps to collect important information, such as memory contents, unencrypted data, passwords, and open network connections. It will be difficult to avoid contamination, since the tools and commands you will use will change the time and date of file access, use DLLs or shared libraries, trigger malware, or even reboot the device. The static acquisition is when the target machine is powered off. In such cases, you could remove the hard drive and connect it to a hardware write-blocker or boot it into a live forensic OS. Write-blockers prevent the modification of the hard drive since the device allows read-only from the evidence drive. Examples of static data are emails, images, word documents, web activity, spreadsheet, slack space, swap files, unallocated drive space, and deleted files. Local acquisition is when you have physical access to the investigated system\nWhile in remote acquisition, you will need network tools to create connections for evidence acquisition.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Types of Evidence","level":2,"id":"Types_of_Evidence_0"},{"heading":"Copy vs Image vs Clone","level":2,"id":"Copy_vs_Image_vs_Clone_0"},{"heading":"Tips for Acquisition","level":2,"id":"Tips_for_Acquisition_0"},{"heading":"Chain of Custody","level":2,"id":"Chain_of_Custody_0"},{"heading":"Validating Data Acquisition","level":2,"id":"Validating_Data_Acquisition_0"},{"heading":"Physical vs Logical Acquisition","level":2,"id":"Physical_vs_Logical_Acquisition_0"},{"heading":"Live vs Static Acquisition","level":2,"id":"Live_vs_Static_Acquisition_0"},{"heading":"Local vs Remote Acquisition","level":2,"id":"Local_vs_Remote_Acquisition_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"for-120/evidence-acquisition.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["assets/pasted-image-20260124021526.html"],"createdTime":1769238457485,"modifiedTime":1769240312395,"sourceSize":4392,"sourcePath":"FOR-120/Evidence Acquisition.md","exportPath":"for-120/evidence-acquisition.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":23,"backlinks":["for-120/for-120-overview.html","sec-110/sec-110-overview.html"],"type":"markdown"},"for-120/for-120-overview.html":{"title":"FOR-120 Overview","icon":"","description":"\n<a data-href=\"Evidence Acquisition\" href=\"for-120/evidence-acquisition.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Evidence Acquisition</a> - Proper handling and preservation\n<br><a data-href=\"Forensic Image Formats\" href=\"for-120/forensic-image-formats.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Forensic Image Formats</a> - Understanding evidence containers <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Glossary &gt;

Also, forcing your computer to work with corrupted or unrecognized formats will cause it to write data incorrectly, possibly rendering unrecoverable all the files stored on the media.Mounting ensures that your computer recognizes the media's format; if your computer cannot recognize that format, the device cannot be mounted. When media is successfully mounted, your computer incorporates the media's file system into your local file system, and creates a mount point, a locally available link through which you access an external device.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Overview","level":1,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Why?","level":1,"id":"Why?_0"},{"heading":"Self Reading","level":1,"id":"Self_Reading_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"for-120/image-mounting.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1770418599027,"modifiedTime":1770418859398,"sourceSize":2118,"sourcePath":"FOR-120/Image Mounting.md","exportPath":"for-120/image-mounting.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":26,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"for-120/storage-devices.html":{"title":"Storage Devices","icon":"","description":"Four Categories of storage media:\nMagnetic media Hard Disks and Tapes Non-volatile memory (flash)\nOptical media. <img alt=\"Pasted image 20260117002459.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20260117002459.png\" target=\"_self\"> Versions/Speeds 1.5 Gb/s for SATA 1\n3.0 Gb/s for SATA 2\n6 Gb/s (~700MB/s) for SATA 3\n16 Gb/s for SATA 3.2 has card-edge connector Versions/Speeds 3 Gb/s for SAS 1\n6 Gb/s for SAS 2\n12 Gb/s for SAS 3\n22.5 Gb/s for SAS 4 Same connector/interface as SATA, but has separator aka Scuzzy\nup to 320 Mb/s\nSCSI-2: 50-pin interface, Molex power\nSCSI-3: 68-pin interface, Molex power\nSCSI-3 variant: 80-pin interface 133 Mb/s\nhas pin connector\n40-position connector; 39-pin interface\nIDE drive jumper options Master\nSlave\nCable select\nNote original jumper setting prior to imaging Standard power connector\nHDDs has 3 storage sizes:\n3.5 in\n2.5 in\n1.8 in\nParts of a drive:\n**\nround flat, magnetic or ceramic discs in a hard drive that holds the actual data Made of two materials Substrate Material Magnetic Media Coating Each platter has two sides sides are numbered starting at 0 Most drives have multiple platters Each platter has tracks, which is where data is stores Most platters have 10k+ tracks\nTrack numbering start at 0 from the outside\nStacks of tracks are called cylinders Number of cylinders (tracks), heads (sides), and sectors (aka CHS) uniquely identify the physical geometry of the storage units on a disk CHS also yields disk capacity:\nCapacity = Cylinders x Heads x Sectors x sector size\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20260116134011.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20260116134011.png\" target=\"_self\"> Trend toward less platters with more density Each track has sectors 1 sector = 512 bytes (sometimes 4096) and a few extra \"info bits\" Info bits include ID info, synchronization fields, and ECC data.

SSL is the deprecated predecessor to TLS.UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - A connectionless protocol that sends data without establishing a connection or guaranteeing delivery, used for time-sensitive applications like video streaming.Unallocated Space - Areas of a storage device that are not currently assigned to any file. Often contains deleted files or fragments of deleted data.Update - A newer version of software that may include patches, new features, performance improvements, or security enhancements.URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - The address used to access resources on the internet, specifying the protocol, domain, path, and potentially query parameters.Validation - The process of verifying that a forensic image is identical to the source evidence, typically using hash algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-2.Virtual Machine (VM) - A software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications as if it were a physical machine.Virtualization - The creation of virtual (rather than physical) versions of computing resources like servers, storage devices, or networks.VPN (Virtual Private Network) - A technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.Vulnerability - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. A weakness in a system, application, or network that could be exploited by threats to gain unauthorized access or cause harm.Vulnerability Assessment - The systematic process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system.WAN (Wide Area Network) - A network that covers a broad area, connecting multiple LANs across cities, countries, or continents.Wannacry - Infamous ransomware. A ransomware attack in May 2017 that infected over 200,000 computers across 150 countries, exploiting a Windows vulnerability and causing billions in damages.White Box Testing - Security testing where the tester has full knowledge of the internal structure, design, and code of the system being tested.World Wide Web - An information system where documents and resources are identified by URLs, interlinked by hypertext, and accessible via the internet. Invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.Write-Blocker - A hardware or software tool that allows read-only access to data storage devices, preventing any modification of evidence during forensic examination.Zero Trust - A security model based on the principle \"never trust, always verify,\" requiring strict identity verification for everyone trying to access resources regardless of location.Zero-Day Exploit - An attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability before the software vendor has released a patch.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"A","level":2,"id":"A_0"},{"heading":"B","level":2,"id":"B_0"},{"heading":"C","level":2,"id":"C_0"},{"heading":"D","level":2,"id":"D_0"},{"heading":"E","level":2,"id":"E_0"},{"heading":"F","level":2,"id":"F_0"},{"heading":"G","level":2,"id":"G_0"},{"heading":"H","level":2,"id":"H_0"},{"heading":"I","level":2,"id":"I_0"},{"heading":"L","level":2,"id":"L_0"},{"heading":"M","level":2,"id":"M_0"},{"heading":"N","level":2,"id":"N_0"},{"heading":"O","level":2,"id":"O_0"},{"heading":"P","level":2,"id":"P_0"},{"heading":"R","level":2,"id":"R_0"},{"heading":"S","level":2,"id":"S_0"},{"heading":"T","level":2,"id":"T_0"},{"heading":"U","level":2,"id":"U_0"},{"heading":"V","level":2,"id":"V_0"},{"heading":"W","level":2,"id":"W_0"},{"heading":"Z","level":2,"id":"Z_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"glossary.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768547676811,"modifiedTime":1769243901213,"sourceSize":28273,"sourcePath":"Glossary.md","exportPath":"glossary.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":91,"backlinks":["for-120/for-120-overview.html","sec-110/sec-110-overview.html"],"type":"markdown"},"welcome.html":{"title":"Welcome","icon":"","description":"Connor
