The ultimate goal of a digital forensics investigation is to preserve, identify, acquire and document digital evidence to be used in the court of law.
Acquisition is the single most important step. You get one chance, because looking through files or booting up the computer will destroy the evidence. Things to consider procedurally: Order of volatility
Imaging methods
Forensic image files formats
Capabilities of imaging tools
Keep continuity in mind.&nbsp;
Write-blockers
Image validation.
Last but most important documentation, aka CoC. Of the types below, the first two can only be captured while the machine being investigated is running.

During an investigation, the original evidence cannot be analyzed directly. A copy must be used to avoid contamination. A copy provides the actual data of a file without any extra information, such as the file’s metadata.
Because of the importance of metadata and other information on the drive, digital forensic investigators capture an image of the drive.
Imaging an evidence drive allows capturing the entire drive bit-by-bit, including actual files, data in slack space, swap files, and unallocated space (which may contain deleted files).
If a drive failed, you can replace it with its clone, not its image
Images can be compressed and fragmented Create two images from the evidence drive, hence, in case one got corrupted, the second one can be used for further analysis.
Use two different tools for image acquisition. Photos can be attached to the CoC to show the evidence state at the collection time. This is very important in case of acquiring a powered-on machine, which has running applications on its screen. Acquisition validation is used to ensure that the forensic image is identical to the source.
Validation of digital evidence involves using a hashing algorithm to generate a hash value (aka fingerprint), which is a unique binary or hexadecimal number.
Identical files will always have the same fingerprint even if their names differ.
Integrity check guarantees that the data has not been corrupted or altered during the acquisition process. data integrity should be verified using verification algorithms, such as: Message Digest 5 (MD5) hash
Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)
SHA-2 The physical image is the entire hard drive; it copies all zeroes and ones on the drive. Hence, a physical image of a 1TB drive will generate an image file of size 1 TB. This is the most common in digital forensic and it is important in case you suspect that the evidence has been deleted or modified. The logical image is a part of the hard drive, a certain volume(s) of the drive. For example, if a hard drive contains two partitions, D and E, the logical image would be data from E: drive or D: drive. This is very useful in case you are interested only in the information contained in the drive. In some cases, you know what files you need for the investigation. If the target machine is powered on and running, the acquisition is called live acquisition Live acquisition helps to collect important information, such as memory contents, unencrypted data, passwords, and open network connections. It will be difficult to avoid contamination, since the tools and commands you will use will change the time and date of file access, use DLLs or shared libraries, trigger malware, or even reboot the device. The static acquisition is when the target machine is powered off. In such cases, you could remove the hard drive and connect it to a hardware write-blocker or boot it into a live forensic OS. Write-blockers prevent the modification of the hard drive since the device allows read-only from the evidence drive. Examples of static data are emails, images, word documents, web activity, spreadsheet, slack space, swap files, unallocated drive space, and deleted files. Local acquisition is when you have physical access to the investigated system
While in remote acquisition, you will need network tools to create connections for evidence acquisition.

If not, it asks the operating system.
If the operating system doesn't know, it asks a Resolving Name Server Usually automatically defined but might be set manually If the resolving name server doesn't know, it asks the Root domain server. All resolving name servers should know the root name server If the Root domain server doesn't know, it tells the Resolving Name Server to ask the TLD name server (provided by the Root domain server)
If the TLD name server doesn't know, the resolving name server asks the authoritative name server (provided by the TLD server) The TLD Domain Server keeps records of all domain's authoritative domain servers. (ie the .com TLD server knows All .com websites authoritative name servers) The answer from the authoritative name server is then cached by the resolving name server, and passed along to the client operating system. A&nbsp; - Address Record used to resolve a name to an IPv4 address (the most common record)
CNAME - Canonical Name Record used to alias one name to another
AAAA - Address Record used to resolve a name to an IPv6 address&nbsp;
PTR - Pointer Record used to resolve IPv4 address to a name (inverse query)
MX - Mail Exchange used to identify the email servers for a domain&nbsp;
SRV - Service locator used to locate services such as SIP servers, Conference Servers or other services

HDDs has 3 storage sizes:
3.5 in
2.5 in
1.8 in
Parts of a drive:
**
round flat, magnetic or ceramic discs in a hard drive that holds the actual data Made of two materials Substrate Material Magnetic Media Coating Each platter has two sides sides are numbered starting at 0 Most drives have multiple platters Each platter has tracks, which is where data is stores Most platters have 10k+ tracks
Track numbering start at 0 from the outside
Stacks of tracks are called cylinders Number of cylinders (tracks), heads (sides), and sectors (aka CHS) uniquely identify the physical geometry of the storage units on a disk CHS also yields disk capacity:
Capacity = Cylinders x Heads x Sectors x sector size
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20260116134011.png" src="assets/pasted-image-20260116134011.png" target="_self"> Trend toward less platters with more density Each track has sectors 1 sector = 512 bytes (sometimes 4096) and a few extra "info bits" Info bits include ID info, synchronization fields, and ECC data. Sectors can turn bad beacuse of: excessive read/writes
some viruses
voltage surges Drives have reserved sectors, which are used as others fail
bad sectors are difficult to see by normal operating systems, requires special hardware Data on HDDs can be spread out, called fragmentation.
Fragmentation increases seek time/delay SSDs use flash based storage and a controller Constant seek time
No file fragmentation issues
No moving parts no mechanical failures
fast startup time
no motor noise Lighter weight
low power Overwriting process is complicated &amp; expensive read-erase-modify-write cycle Cells have limited life/cycles Wear leveling must be used SSDs are significantly harder to save data from 1 page = 8 sections/sectors (512 bytes)
Pages make up blocks
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20260116235700.png" src="assets/pasted-image-20260116235700.png" target="_self"> Write is fast
But rewrite/overwrite involves additional erasing step
Entire Blocks (not pages or sections) must be erased
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20260117000152.png" src="assets/pasted-image-20260117000152.png" target="_self">

Like hard disks SSDs have extra capacity not accessible by normal users
Unlike hard disks Approx. 10-25% more storage than stated capacity, Overprovisioned areas are continuously used File Deletion on a normal HDD File is marked as deleted in the File system’s database
HDD has no clue which sectors are freed up
TRIM marks data blocks as stale SSDs need to know this info.
